### Explanation of Design Patterns  
> I fulfilled the requirements for x by ...  

> The requirements for Builder Pattern : step-by-step creation of complex objects using the correct sequence of actions
> The requirements for Decorator Pattern : handled dynamically, and it adds behavior to the object it wraps. Structurally, it inherits and contains the component.  
> The requirements for Adaptor Pattern : handled statically and it adjusts the interface of the object it wraps. Structurally, it contains an adaptee.  
> The requirements for Strategy Pattern : A family of algorithms are made interchangeable through encapsulation. The algorithms are managed independently instead of inside the method with a large switch statement.  
> The requirements for Observer Pattern : Two concrete objects inherit the attributes of the related abstract objects. When an object state changes, all displays are automatically notified and updated to reflect the change.  
> The requirements for State Pattern : Provides behavior to an object so that it can be changed during runtime, implementing a state machine.  

> I fulfilled the requirements for Builder Pattern by complex creation of large objects (Startup) & (TechGiant) and its interactions with the rest of the game.  
> I fulfilled the requirements for Observer Pattern by updating and displaying values to Player as they happen.  
> I fulfilled the requirements for Strategy Pattern by allowing bot to make various inputs based on events in-game.  
> I fulfilled the requirements for a Singleton Pattern by only initializing a singular instance of GameEngine for the game.
